/* This file defines two property types for our SDE example. They are meant
 * purely for illustrative purposes (there's much better ways of defining APIs
 * for computing the area and higher-order analogs). The header file will be
 * used again for later examples.
 */

/* The Area property type is very basic. For all intents and purposes it defines
 * a functor with an API:
 *
 * double run(double, double)
 *
 * where the return is the area of the shape and the two inputs are the
 * dimensions of the shape (exactly what these two values are, say whether they
 * are base and height of a triangle or length and width of a rectangle, is
 * left up to the module). The class itself shows:
 *
 *  - Declares the fields in the API for the input/output of modules satisfying
 *    this property type, i.e., it says all modules computing areas take two
 *    doubles and return a double.
 *    - The input API is declared by implementing the "virtual" function (the
 *      function is polymorphic, but compile-time polymorphic, meaning there
 *      is no corresponding "virtual" function in the base class) inputs_()
 *      and the output API is declared via the results_() function
 *  - Inputs can be copies/values
 *

         * add_field to be chained. The actual return type will in general be a
         * mess so it is strongly recommended that you use auto to spare
         * yourself that detail.

         *
         * will not work as intended. The first one will compile, but creates an
         * API with no fields because the new fields are stored in the returned
         * object, which is thrown away. The second example will fail to
         * compile because the return types of add_field are different than
         * the type of rv.

 * of each element are again left to the module. This class showcases:
 *
 * - Inputs can be read-only references that avoid copies (we prohibit
 *   read/write references as input parameters to mitigate against memoization
 *   breakdowns)
 * - Property types can return multiple values (assuming the result is used
