Developing Scientific Software

.. warning::

   The authors of this section are primarily developers of electronic structure
   software. The views and anecdotal evidence throughout this section draw
   heavily from this experience. While we believe this page reflects scientific
   software as a whole, the reader should bear this warning in mind.

Starting in the 2010s there have been a number of efforts to improve the state
of scientific software including:

- The Molecular Sciences Software Institute :cite:`molssi`
- TODO list more

Of course the fact that so many efforts exist suggests that there is a deep
seeded problem with how scientific software has historically been developed.
