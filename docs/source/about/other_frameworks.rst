Other Frameworks
================

So why write SDE? Aren't there other C++ plugin frameworks out there? Well, in
the interest of transparency it's worth admitting that the SDE was written
before checking if other frameworks existed. It's worth at some point seeing if
others exist and if so comparing and contrasting the SDE with them.
