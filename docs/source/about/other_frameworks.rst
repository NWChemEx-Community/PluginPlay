Other Frameworks
================

So why write pluginplay? Aren't there other C++ plugin frameworks out there? Well, in
the interest of transparency it's worth admitting that the pluginplay was written
before checking if other frameworks existed. It's worth at some point seeing if
others exist and if so comparing and contrasting the pluginplay with them.
