Terminology and Conventions
***************************

The purpose of this page is to introduce the terminology used by the SDE as well
as the conventions we follow throughout the documentation.

Terminology
===========

Basic Terms
-----------

* module: a self-contained piece of code. Modules wrap developer provided code 
  in a common API that can be used by the rest of the SDE. End-users typically 
  do not work directly with modules, they work with...
* property type: A property type is a domain-specific quantity of interest. For
  example if your code computes geometric properties of shapes then you may have
  property types for area, volume, and perimeter. Basically these are the
  quantities that users of your code will want to compute and they define the
  manners in which a module can be called.
* module collection: these are groups of modules that are distributed together.
  In C++ module collections will be libraries, whereas in Python they will be
  Python modules.
* memoization: A technique where repeated calls to an expensive function, with
  the same input, are avoided by saving the input to the function and the
  result of calling the function.

Module State
------------

* bound input: For a particular module, ``M``, an input ``k`` is said to be
  bound if the ``ModuleInput`` instance returned by ``M.inputs().at("k")`` has
  a value. When a module is called as a particular property type, all inputs
  not appearing in the definition of the property type must be bound.
* bound submodule: Same as a "bound input" except that it refers to one of the
  submodules that a module will call instead of one of the input options.
* transparent: An input to a module is "transparent" if the result of the
  module does not depend on the value. Most inputs are "opaque" in that their
  values do change the value. Examples of transparent options include debug
  printing levels and options that affect the speed at which an algorithm
  computes (block sizes, number of threads, *etc.*).
* opaque: The opposite of transparent. An option is "opaque" it changing its
  value changes the result of a module.
* locked: A module is said to be locked if the end-user accessible state can no
  longer be changed. This occurs when a module is run and prevents concurrent
  access from invalidating memoization.
