Terminology and Conventions
===========================

The purpose of this page is to introduce the terminology used by the SDE as well
as the conventions we follow throughout the documentation.

Terminology
-----------

* module: a self-contained executable piece of code. Modules wrap developer
  provided code in a common API that can be used by the rest of the SDE. End-
  users typically do not work directly with modules, they work with...
* property type: A property type is a domain-specific quantity of interest. For
  example if your code computes geometric properties of shapes then you may have
  property types for area, volume, and perimeter. Basically these are the
  quantities that users of your code will want to compute.
