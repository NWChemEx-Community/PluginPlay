Module Development
##################

Most of the time when a developer interacts with PluginPlay it is by
developing modules. The topics in this part focus on developing modules. For
concreteness, the documentation in this section assumes we are writing
modules pertaining to very basic electromagnetism (aka E&M). PluginPlay is
domain agnostic. The tutorials rely on E&M simply because we anticipate
that a wide swath of our target audience is familiar with E&M. In practice
any reader familiar with basic calculus should be able to follow these
tutorials.
