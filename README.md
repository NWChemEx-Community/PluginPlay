PluginPlay is an inversion-of-control (IoC) framework to facilitate wrtiting
high-performance modular scientific software. More specifically, using
PluginPlay scientific software is written as a series of disconnected modules.
At runtime the modules are loaded into PluginPlay and then PluginPlay wires the
modules together to form a call graph. A more detailed overview can be found
[here](https://nwchemex-project.github.io/PluginPlay/background/overview.html).

# Features

From the perspective of high-performance scientific software development, the
main features enjoyed by a program built on top of PluginPlay are:

- Want to call your new optimizer everwhere an optimizer is needed without
  modifying those places, or even knowing where those places are? Runtime
  dependency injection lets you do just that!
- Memoization of the call graph. PluginPlay automatically records the execution
  of the call graph, which facilitates saving/loading a calcualtion.
- Plugin-based development. In C++ there is no need to recompile anything other
  than your plugin while developing it. Notably all other plugins and the
  program consuming the plugins, do not need to be recompiled!

A full feature list can be found
[here](https://nwchemex-project.github.io/PluginPlay/features.html).

# Install

PluginPlay ultimately uses CMake for configuring and building. This means that
installation is usually achieved via a variation on:

```.sh
git clone https://github.com/NWChemEx-Project/PluginPlay
cd PluginPlay
cmake -H. -Bbuild -D...
cmake --build build --target install
```
More detailed install instructions can be found
[here](https://nwchemex-project.github.io/PluginPlay/install.html).
