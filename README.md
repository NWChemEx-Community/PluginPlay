Simulation Development Environment (SDE)
=========================================

The SDE represents a reusable framework for building a computational chemistry
program.  In particular it is in the SDE one will find:

- Abstractions of the hardware
  - APIs for I/O, accessing parallel resources, *etc.*
- Abstractions for modifying and monitoring the state of the calculation
  - Current algorithms, calculation state, *etc.*
- Hooks for extending functionality.
- Support for scripting
