===============

The NWChemExRuntime repo is the home of classes and infrastructure that are 
designed to abstract away details pertaining to the environment that NWChemEx is
being run in.  Such details include hardware, parallelization, and 
calculation details.

Building
--------

NWChemExRuntime relies on NWChemExBase to manage its configuration and build 
settings.  More details on how to build this library can be found
