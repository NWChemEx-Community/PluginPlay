PluginPlay
==========

[Documentation](https://nwchemex-project.github.io/PluginPlay/)

Warning!!!! PluginPlay is currently in alpha. 

At this points APIs should be stable, but expect bugs and 
performance issues. We are actively improving PluginPlay
in concert with NWChemEx. As downstream work continues on
NWChemEx expect PluginPlay to improve. FWIW, we expect a 
1.0 release of PluginPlay late 2022.
