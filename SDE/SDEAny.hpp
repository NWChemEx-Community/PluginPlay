/** @brief The SDEAny class is capable of holding an instance of any type in a
 *  type-safe manner.
 *
 *  The primary motivation for this class is sometimes you just want to store a
 *  bunch of objects, of different types, in the same container.  Since in C++
 *  types do not all inherit from some common type (like Python's Object class
 *  for example) the SDEAny class provides a mock common base class.  Ultimately
 *  this class works by type-erasure.
 *
 *  To use this class:
 *  @code
 *  //To put value into the SDEAny instance
 *  double value = 2.0;
 *  auto wrapped_value = make_SDEAny(value);
 *
 *  //To get the value back
 *  double retrieved_value = SDEAnyCast<double>(wrapped_value);
 *  @endcode
 *
 *
 *  @note Interestingly the universal reference constructor takes precedence
 *  over the copy constructor, hence the meta-template programming.
