/** @brief Class designed to wrap a returned computed result.
 *
 *  @relates ComputedProperties
 *
 *  This class wraps each of the objects stored in the ComputedProperties class
 *  and is not really intended for use apart from the ComputedProperties class.
 *  At the moment this is a simple class that just wraps an `SDEAny` instance.
 *  Down the road one can imagine making it more like a continuation, where
 *  instead of holding the value it holds a callback that computes the value.
 *
 *  Generally speaking the objects returned by modules are heavy. For this
 *  reason this class stores the object as a shared_ptr. A handle to this shared
 *  pointer can be obtained using the `get` function (modeled after the
 *  `shared_ptr` class itself). Typically, however, a user will want to go
 *  through the `value` function which returns a const reference to the actual
 *  result (const reference because the object is a result of a scientific
 *  computation and therefore should be treated as immutable).
 *
