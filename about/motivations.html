  <section id="motivations">
<h1>Motivations<a class="headerlink" href="#motivations" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>PluginPlay, is general software not directly tied to computational science;
however, its motivations derived from computational science applications.
This page details those motivations.</p>
<p>In designing a software package for computational science you need to consider
how that software will interact with four groups of people:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>End-users: people who are going to run your software to do science.</p></li>
<li><p>Developer: people who write and implement new code in your package.</p></li>
<li><p>External developer: people who write new code oblivious to your package.</p></li>
<li><p>Funding agencies: people paying everyone above.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These groups are not exclusive, for example developers usually also use the
software they are developing for.</p>
<section id="funding-agencies">
<h2>Funding Agencies<a class="headerlink" href="#funding-agencies" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>In the grand scheme of things this is the group of people that probably has the
most influence on a package. This is because, even if you have the greatest
program ever, if no one is being funded to work on/use your program, your
program is not long for this world. It thus behooves package designers to ensure
that their packages stay relevant to their backers. For scientific computing
this boils down to the package being able to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>solve scientific problems of interest</p></li>
<li><p>run on architectures of interest</p></li>
<li><p>integrate with other packages of interest</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, these are moving targets as today’s problems, become of less
interest once solutions are developed. As for design implications this
highlights the need for the resulting software to be flexible and modular. The
former ensures that the program is up to any challenge and the latter
facilitates refactoring that may need to occur as a result of a new direction.</p>
</section>
<section id="external-developer">
<h2>External Developer<a class="headerlink" href="#external-developer" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Although an external developer will not directly work on the package, their work
does not occur in a vacuum. In particular the external developer’s software may
contain:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>superior versions of our package’s algorithms</p></li>
<li><p>features of interest to our user</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The important thing to note about the external developer’s work is that they are
designing their software, their way. This means that in general external
developers are not going to produce software with APIs that are interoperable
with our package’s APIs. Rather our package needs to be capable of adapting to
the API of the external package with minimal effort. Again, this highlights
the need for flexible and modular code.</p>
</section>
<section id="developer">
<h2>Developer<a class="headerlink" href="#developer" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Developers are the people who are going to write code for the package. In
science they are willing to do some code maintenance, but overall they are
usually looking for a software framework that facilitates:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>rapid testing/implementation of new algorithms</p></li>
<li><p>repackaging of the new algorithms</p></li>
<li><p>performance with minimal effort</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The focus on repackaging is a somewhat recent development (at least in
computational chemistry). This stems from a number of pressures including:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>developers are involved with multiple packages</p></li>
<li><p>funding agencies wanting developer code to be generally applicable</p></li>
<li><p>developers wanting a fallback plan if the package becomes vaporware</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Admittedly, what features are required of a software package in order for it
to satisfy the developer’s needs is subjective to the developer. Again,
flexibility becomes important; however, now we see a need for flexibility that
includes the literal coding language as well as the packaging procedures.</p>
</section>
<section id="end-user">
<h2>End-User<a class="headerlink" href="#end-user" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>End-users are using your software as a means to an end. While some may be
fiercely loyal, and would use your software come hell or high water, most are
using your package because it makes it easy for them to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>customize the program for their scientific problem</p></li>
<li><p>solve their problem in a reasonable amount of time</p></li>
<li><p>integrate the package into their workflows</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Flexibility is again important. Whereas the last three sections really focused
on flexibility of the literal source code, here flexibility deals more with
control flow. Every science problem is unique, and consequentially every usage
of a scientific package will be too. Modularity within the source code helps
deliver this flexible user-experience.</p>
</section>
<section id="summary">
<h2>Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>What the above use cases highlight is that scientific software needs to first
and foremost be flexible. This makes a lot of sense given it is being used for
research, which is an inherently uncertain thing. The other reoccurring theme is
modularity. Scientific software needs to be Lego-like in the sense that you have
a lot of fundamental pieces that are interoperable, which can be combined into
arbitrary designs.</p>
